## Welcome to the tutorials section of the documentation!
Here you will find a collection of tutorials that will help you get started with the basics of using the **MathLikeAnim-rs** library. If you are new to the library, we recommend you to start with the [Installation Guide](/tutorial-Install%20the%20library.html) to learn how to install the library on your JavaScript project, and then go to the [Get Started](/tutorial-Get%20started.html) tutorial to learn how to create interactive mathematical animations for the web.
