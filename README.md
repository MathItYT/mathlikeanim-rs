# MathLikeAnim-rs

This is a simple Rust library to create mathematical animations.
The objective is to have the same capabilities as [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), but in Rust.

**Note**: This is a work in progress, it's very preliminary and not ready for use. ⚠️

Examples are available in the `examples` directory.
